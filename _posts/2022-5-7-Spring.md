# 1. Create Project

We can get access to [Spring](https://start.spring.io/) and download the project. Don't forget to add 'Spring Web' dependency.

After that, we can run the project with IDEA. It'll take around 20 minutes to download the necessary files. Then, we can follow the guidance from [Quick Start](https://spring.io/quickstart) to test the installation.

If you got trouble 'Port 8080 was already in use', you can create a file 'application.yml' in the 'resource' directory, and add the configuration.

```
server:
  port: 8044
```
