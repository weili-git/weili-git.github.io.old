# 1. Classification Problem

Supposed that we are given a batch of data $$D=\{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_m, y_m)\},y_i \in \{-1,1\}$$, and we want to find a hyper-plane such that it can properly divide these two class of data. A good hyper-plane should be able to accept slight disturbance.

## Multi-class Classification

A classification task with the assumption that each sample belongs to one and only one class. $${dog, cat}$$

## Multi-label Classification

A classification task that handle several joint classification tasks. $${cat, young, female}$$

# 2. Mathematical Description

We use $$\{w, b\}$$ to describe a hyper-plane, where $$w$$ is the normal vector and $$b$$ is the displacement vector.

The distance of any sample $$x$$ to the hyper-plane is $$r=\frac{|w^Tx+b|}{||w||}$$. Then the classification problem is equivalent to the followings.

$$\max_{w,b}\frac{2}{||w||} ~~ s.t. ~~ y_i(w^Tx+b)\ge 1, i=1,2,...,m$$

Here, $$\frac{2}{||w||}$$ is called the margin (间隔), which is as great as possible.
