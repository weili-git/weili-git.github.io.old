When I was in college, I bought a pair of scissors in the supermarket. It's durable and handy. Every time I use it to cut things, an inexplicable "sense of fulfillment" flooded into my heart. Although it is merely an ordinary pair of scissors, with the increase of use, I seem to have "relied" on it. Why do you say that? Because there are many times that I spend a lot of time finding it, even though several other scissors are at home. Only by cutting things with it can I feel at ease and comfortable. If one day I leave it in a corner and struggle for it again, I will feel full of anxiety. What's worse, since then I would even drop proper business and instead focus on this trivial matter. It's terrible!
